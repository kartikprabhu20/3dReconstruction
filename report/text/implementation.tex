\section{3D-Scene framework}

Replacing models, lighting(indoor and outdoor), randomisation of texture, camera distance, camera angles, outdoor skybox,
UI controls
Manual inputs, automated
Unity - ML-ImageSynthesis
UML diagram is needed? (If it helps)

\section{3d-Reconstruction framework}
Development environment
Training setup(hardware, voxel sizeâ€¦)
Mixed precision using apex
If mixed precision helped performance, memory, speed, evaluation metric


\section{Implement a domain adaptation technique}
To serve as a proof if more domain gap reduction is needed
